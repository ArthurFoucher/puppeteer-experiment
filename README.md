# Puppeteer experiment
This repo is just an excuse to get used to setting up a typescript project with minimal dependencies.
Creating a small scraping app with puppetteer gives me the opoortunity to set up my own config and lint files, figure out how typescript resolves types, etc


# Run
To run the program, execute `npm run dev`

To re-run on save, install nodemon and run `nodemon -e ts -w ./src -x npm run dev`
